# Web Sample Application

The DigitalPersona Web Sample Application illustrates the low-level RESTful calls and structures that can be used to build a web-based client for use with the DigitalPersona AD or LDS Server.

As an alternative, you can use the higher level JavaScript [Authentication](.\digitalpersona-authentication.md) and [Enrollment](.\digitalpersona-enrollment.md) APIs, which isolate developers from the low-level REST protocol calls, data and details about data structures, encodings etc.
